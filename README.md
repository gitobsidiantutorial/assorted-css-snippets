### Description
Credit goes to Manedblackwolf who created the kanban snippet for her [Spectrum theme](https://github.com/Braweria/Spectrum).

Turns all unordered lists in a designated document into a kanban 'table'. Unindented entries become headers for new columns. Indented children become rows under their parent entries.

Kanbans also allow you to transclude documents side by side.

### Usage
To use kanbans, the following must be at the top of a document. Afterwards, all unordered lists within that document will be turned into kanbans.

```css
---
cssclass: kanban
---
```
